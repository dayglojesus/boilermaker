Boilermaker relies on Apple's Packagemaker and as such, it is subject to the same limitations. Bugs
that are expressed by Apple's utility will also affect boilermaker.

Once installed, boilermaker can be invoked from the commandline as:

	boilermaker

Or simply...

	bm

Boilermaker help can be obtained by running the utility without any arguments, OR by specifying:

boilermaker --help

Documentation on the code base can be obtained by running:

bmdocs
