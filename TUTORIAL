QUICK TUTORIAL

You must complete the installation before completing the tutorial.

1. Open Terminal.app
2. Type: bm -C ./foobar
3. Type: cd ./foobar
4. Optional
	4a. Edit: foobar.yaml
		-- Edit the YAML to your liking
	4b. Type: mkdir -p pkgroot/tmp
		-- pkgroot dir represents the root of the target OS (ie. "/tmp")
		-- this is where you would stage your payload
	4c. Add some files to the new tmp folder
		-- Type: touch pkgroot/tmp/my.boilermaker.payload
5. Type: bm -b
6. Type: sudo bm -p
7. Type: bm -r

You have now built a standard Mac OS X package, and have prepared it for distribution
by rolling it into a Disk Image.


ANATOMY OF A BOILERMAKER PROJ DIRECTORY

./build: This is where your actual Mac OS X packages land
-- Whenever you perform a boilermaker 'build' operation, the subsequent .pkg will land
in this directory.

./foobar.yaml: The boilermaker project config file
-- A YAML file which contains all the variables and info about your package.

./pkgroot: The staging area for your package's payload
-- The pkgroot directory represents the root of your package's target OS.
-- Example: ./pkgroot/Applications/Foobar.app would be installed as: /Applications/Foobar.app

./resources: Assorted resources related to your package
-- This directory can contain an assortment of resources related to your package. Extra scripts,
images, localizations, etc. all go in here.
-- It can also be used a pre-staging area. Example: you do not wish to create a static pkgroot 
structure, but instead intend to use a script to copy items from a another location. You could
use a sub-dir the resources dir as your source (ie. ./resources/pkgpayload).
-- The default background.gif is also stored here. This item is copied out of
/Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/boilermaker/resources anytime a new project is instantiated. You may replace 
this image with an image of your choosing. The size of the image should be 622 x 418 pixels.

./scripts: Used to store your package scripts
-- Boilermaker also populates this directory with empty scripts. You may edit them to your liking or
delete any or all of them.
